- **Tech-Focused Categories Only**  
  Only resumes belonging to technical roles such as `Java Developer`, `Python Developer`, `Data Science`, etc., were retained.

- **Word Count Range**  
  Only resumes with a word count **between 150 and 800 words** were kept to exclude incomplete or overly long entries.
